CSE303 - Fall 2016
Assignment #3: The "User-Level Rootkit" and Defense

Purpose and General Guidelines:

  We typically do not write code that makes system calls directly.  Instead,
  we usually rely on a library (the "C standard library") to wrap system
  calls in stub code that abstracts away differences among possible
  underlying operating systems.  This greatly simplifies programming.

  In order to increase security, we typically store the C standard library as
  a shared object (a .so file in Unix, a .dll in Windows).  If a bug or
  security flaw is found in the library, we can simply replace it, and all
  programs will get the new version when they are executed.

  However, anyone with shell access can override the default location of a
  shared library.  This is, for example, one way to implement tools like
  valgrind, from Assignment #1: we can override the locations of malloc and
  free, replacing them with special versions that count and track memory, and
  then call the original malloc and free.  This technique is known as library
  interpositioning.

  There is a dark side, though.  Anyone with shell access can override the
  default location of a shared library!  This opens the door to "userland
  rootkits", which can hijack the I/O of a program by sitting between the
  program and the kernel.

  In this project, we will create a very simple userland rootkit.  The
  rootkit will be simpler than what a person with malicious intent would use,
  but it allows us to appreciate aspects of security, trust, and protection
  via hands-on experience.  As the assignment progresses, you will be
  expected to create an attack, then a defense.  As you do so, we encourage
  you to think about the "cat and mouse" game that ensues.  The defense you
  create could be circumvented, once the attacker learns of it.  But the
  counter-offense could also be circumvented, back and forth, for quite some
  time.

  Note, too, that library interpositioning is a powerful technique for making
  extensible code.  This isn't just about doing evil things... loading code
  on the fly is the key to high-availability customizable web servers and
  other tools.
  
  This is a team assignment.  Students may work in groups of two.  Every bit
  of code that a team submits as part of this assignment should be their own
  work.  You may consult question-and-answer websites such as StackOverflow
  to see how other people have tried, failed, and then received assistance in
  their attempts at these and similar problems.  However, you may not use
  other people's code.  Be conservative in your judgment.  Anything on GitHub
  is obviously off limits.  Anything copied verbatim from the web is
  unacceptable.  Anything written by your classmates is off limits.  By this
  point in your academic career, you should know how to be ethical.

Getting the Files

  The source code that you will be editing can be found in the
  /proj/spear0 folder on the sunlab machines.  From your sunlab
  account, you should make a protected folder where you will work on this
  project, then copy the source code and unpack it.  You should know how to
  do this by now, but just in case you don't, here is a sequence of commands
  that should work, once you are logged into the sunlab:
  
    cd ~/
    mkdir cse303
    chmod 700 cse303
    cd cse303
    tar -xzvf /proj/spear0/cse303_p3.tgz

  This will create a subfolder with the project 3 source code in it.  The
  assignment requires you to edit the files in the folder to complete several
  tasks.

Task #0: Tell us who you are

  You should edit the 'team.c' file to provide the name and email of each
  member of your team.  Until you do this, none of your programs will
  execute.
  
Task #1: Explore mechanisms for loading shared objects

  The "libpart1.c" file contains a simple function.  When it compiles, it
  complies to a shared object (a ".so") that can be loaded into a program at
  run-time, or dynamically linked at load time.

  1 - Your first sub-task is to learn a bit about the difference between
      run-time and load-time use of shared objects.  We have provided some
      starter code called libpart1.c and part1a.c.  The Makefile will build
      libpart1.c to a shared object, such that its methods can be invoked by
      part1a.  This entails the use of the "-L" and "-l" flags at link time,
      so that the compiler can ensure that the function names expected by
      part1a are present in libpart1.  It also entails the use of the
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to tell the run-time loader where
      to find libpart1.so, since we are not putting it in a standard
      location.  We do this for you: the Makefile has a special rule for the
      part1a executable, and part1a.sh will execute your part1a code with the
      environment correctly configured.

      With that as background, notice the signature of the "hello()" function
      in libpart1.c.  It takes a void*, and it returns a void*.  By packaging
      the paramters as structs, it is possible to use this one signature for
      any behavior, via some careful casting.

      To complete part1a, you should add a new function to libpart1 called
      'ucase'.  It should have the same signature as 'hello', but it should
      expect that it is given the address of a team struct as its parameter.
      Internally, ucase should (1) allocate a new team struct, (2) copy the
      fields of the parameter struct to the fields of the new team struct,
      and then (3) uppercase those fields.  You should also modify part1a.c
      so that it (1) prints the contents of the new struct, in a manner
      similar to check_team(), and (2) takes appropriate action to ensure
      there are no memory leaks reported by valgrind.

  2 - Your second sub-task is to explore mechanisms for dynamic loading of
      shared objects.  The part1b.c file contains an incomplete function
      called load_and_invoke().  You will need to modify the getopt code in
      main(), and then modify load_and_invoke(), so that it uses dlopen(),
      dlsym(), and dlclose() to load a shared object, execute a function, and
      close the shared object.  Be sure to handle errors correctly.  You
      should test this function using, at a minimum, the same "libpart1.so"
      file from the first sub-task.  You should be able to get hello() to
      execute from your part1b executable without modifying the Makefile or
      modifying LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Task #2: Implement basic interpositioning

  Interpositioning is the mechanism by which we have two .so files which
  provide the same function name, and one of the versions of the function
  makes use of the other.  The trick to doing this is to use the dlsym()
  function with a special handle, RTLD_NEXT, to indicate that the original
  .so can be found by traversing the library path.  We will create code that
  mimics the behavior of valgrind.

  Your implementation of malloc() and free() should provide the following
  functionality:

    - You should interpose on malloc() and free() but still call the original
      malloc() and free() functions.  Your goal is *not* to implement your
      own allocator.
  
    - You should count the total number of calls to malloc() and free().
      When your shared library exits, your destructor should print the number
      of un-freed blocks.

    - You should use the GNU backtrace library (the backtrace() function is
      defined in execinfo.h) to get both the name of the module that called
      malloc, and the value of the program counter at the time when malloc
      was called.  Be sure to read the man page for backtrace.  This is an
      amazing tool, which you have seen in use before (e.g., when typing 'bt'
      inside of gdb).

    - You should complete part2_hash.cc, so that on each malloc() you can
      save the results of backtrace(), and on each free() you can "forget"
      some of the saved information.  Then, when your .so is unloaded, you
      should use a destructor to dump the contents of the map.

  Putting it all together, it should be possible to LD_PRELOAD your
  libpart2.so file, and run an arbitrary program.  When the program exits,
  your library should automatically report the number of unfreed allocations,
  and the call sites of those allocations.
      
  Note: You can use the "__attribute__((constructor))" and
        "__attribute__((destructor))" annotations to indicate that a specific
        function in your .so should run when the .so is loaded or unloaded.
        You should leverage this in order to get map_dump() to behave
        correctly.

  Note: This is a single task, but it involves a fair bit of work.  Be sure
        to break the problem into sub-parts and solve them incrementally.

  Note: It is possible that backtrace() uses malloc() and free().  You may
        need to use a static flag within your malloc() and free()
        implementations to enable/disable backtraces, so that backtrace()
        mallocs don't lead to infinite recursion.
  
Task #3: Create a rootkit

  Now we'll use library interpositioning to snoop on the behavior of a
  program.  Our rootkit will watch all printf and scanf operations, and do
  malicious things with the program output.

  The 'inout.c' file produces a simple program that reads from stdin and
  writes to stdout, using scanf and printf.  You can use this as a way to
  test your rootkit.

  In libpart3.c, you should count the number of calls to printf() and
  scanf().  Once four total calls have been made, your library should enter
  its evil mode.  At a minimum, it should use fork(), dup2(), and pipe().
  The desired behavior is that your library should fork a new process, and
  redirect all of the program's output to the child process.  That process
  should behave like the Unix 'tee' program: it should write its output to
  STDOUT, and also write its output to a file.  The name of the file should
  be "evil.txt", unless there is an environment variable named EVILFILENAME,
  in which case the value of that environment variable should be used.
  Finally, when the parent process terminates, the child process should
  perform its final evil action: it should use dlopen to load libexploit.so,
  and libexploit.so should output the captured portion of the output.  You
  will need to update libexploit.c to provide this behavior.

  While this exploit is benign, we could have done much worse: we could have
  sent the captured output to a remote server, or it could have downloaded
  the libexploit.so code from a remote server!

  Note: To test your code, you will need to make use of the LD_PRELOAD
  environment variable.
      
Task #4: Prevent the rootkit

  Finally, let's try to prevent the rootkit.  We want to achieve fail-stop
  behavior, but at the point where we detect that our program has been
  hijacked, there isn't much that we can do.  Our solution will be to use
  mprotect() to make the process's code un-executable, so that continuing to
  run the program will cause a segmentation fault.

  To achieve our desired behavior, we will create ANOTHER .so that can be
  LD_PRELOADed.  The libpart4.c file will interposition on pipe().  That's a
  pretty obvious choice, because we don't expect inout to create pipes.
  Note that what we really want to do is interpose on dlsym itself, but
  that's really tricky.  See, for example,
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15599026/how-can-i-intercept-dlsym-calls-using-ld-preload

  On any call to pipe, your version of pipe will use backtrace() to
  determine if the call to is coming from printf() or scanf().  If not, you
  should pass through to the original pipe code.  In the event that the
  call to pipe() is from printf() or scanf(), you should immediately use
  mprotect() to make the code page of *your* pipe() function
  non-executable.  Continued execution of your program should then cause a
  segfault.
